Project: Text Adventure
Peer's repository: https://github.com/Tempestlyn/03-Text-adventure



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project? I learned a way of tracking inventory in a text based game.

 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects? I liked the introduction where the user can choose what game to play. 

 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code? It all appears to be fine.

 

What could have been clearer or better commented? There aren't many comments towards the end of the code, so more could be added there to explain what is happening there.

 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what? It all made sense to me.

 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE? Yes.

 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive? More instructions, like how to go north, could have been included.

 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

I like how you tracked the players moves and points throughout the duration of the game.
